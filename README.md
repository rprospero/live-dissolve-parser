# Live Dissolve Parser

This is a temporary side project attached to [Project
Dissolve](https://projectdissolve.com/).  After visiting the
[site](https://rprospero.github.io/live-dissolve-parser/), so can past
the contents of an old style dissolve input file.  It will then
provide links for downloading the file formatted as either XML or
JSON.  The JSON can then be converted into YAML or TOML, so needed.
